RELEASING QUILT
===============

Step 1: set the new version and test
------------------------------------

- Bump the version in AC_INIT in configure.ac
- Regenerate configure:
  $ autoconf
  Make sure you don't use a version of autoconf older than the one
  previously used.
- Mention the new version in NEWS, with a summary of all user-visible
  changes.
- Make sure that everything builds and runs fine:
  $ ./configure --prefix=/opt/quilt
  $ make
  $ make check
- If you can update one translation file, do so and commit the po file
  Even better, give ping the translators (their names and emails are
  in the po file headers), and give them the opportunity to update
  their work. 

Step 2: tag the new version
---------------------------

- $ git add configure.ac configure NEWS
  $ git commit -m "Set version to x.y."
  $ git tag vx.y
  $ git push
  $ git push --tags

Step 3: publish the new version
-------------------------------

- If not done already:
  $ ./configure --prefix=/opt/quilt
- $ make publish
