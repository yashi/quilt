-> Describe how to work with hard-linked trees

General:

	- Abstract backup operations to/from the .pc/ directory, so that
	  optionally something like rcs can be used instead of
	  lib/backup-files?

	- Add something similar to cvs diff, which scans all files for
	  changes that have not been folded back into their patches,
	  similar to:
	  `for p in $(quilt series); do quilt diff -z $p; done'?
	
	- Allow to add a directory? Then we could detect also new files
	  in the directory, without having to add them individually.

	- Support different diff/patch options for different patches.
	  (By specifying them in the series file?)

Documentation:

	- How to import a complete directory, before doing
	  wild changes?

quilt refresh:

	- Add an -m option similar to `cvs commit -m "..."' to simplify
	  keeping a change log in the patch documentation?

quilt import:

	- Add option to replace the currently applied patch with a new
	  one, by backing out the topmost patch first.

	- Diff -u the documentation of the old and new file, unless one
	  of them is empty. Let the user decide whether to keep the left
	  or the right documentation, or to merge them both. (-d{ona}?)

quilt setup:

	- Also recognize other uses of tar and patch (with options in the
	  command line), etc.

rpatch:

	- If not removing the topmost patch, add checks if any files are
	  hidden by later patches. If so, refuse to remove patch! (Note
	  that pop takes care of that currently.)

apatch:
	
	- Allow to add a patch in the middle of the applied series, and
	  inject the patch in its proper position in applied-patches.
	  Needs to check if any of the files in the patch are touched by
	  later patches.

quit edit:

	- Check for actual changes, and remove files again that haven't been
	  changed.
