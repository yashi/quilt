quilt (0.39-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release. 
    0.38 were mostly bugfixes, and those bugs were also reported against
      debian package, so I had to steal most of the cvs content already.
    0.39 is also mainly bugfixes. There is a new "mail" command I didn't
      test yet. ;)
      
  * Refuse to add symlinks into patches since we fail to backup them
    properly. (Closes: #294424). Will be in 0.40 ;)
  * Take care of the lost souls patching their config.* files. 
    Cdbs updates them automatically. Thanks to Robert Millan for detecting
    the issue (in cdbs) and proposing a fix (in quilt). (Closes: #295913).
    
    This implies a versionned depend on cdbs (>=0.4.27-1) for using packages, 
    since part of the fix is in there. quilt itself suggests this version.
